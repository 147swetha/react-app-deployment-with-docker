# CI/CD Pipeline with Git,Jenkins, Docker

The objective is to containerize the React app, 
making it easily deployable across various environments. Additionally, 
automation tools like Jenkins and bash scripts will be employed to 
automate the Docker image build and deployment to Docker Hub, 
ensuring a straightforward and cost-effective solution for hosting static 
content. 


This project demonstrates:
- CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
- Dockerizing a sample app
- Automating the pipeline via Jenkins

The Jenkins pipeline automates the 
build, testing, and deployment processes, improving efficiency and 
reducing manual errors. This streamlined automation enhances the 
reliability and speed of delivering updates to production.
